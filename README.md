>Linux terminal commands replaced with Hindi Funny Commands

# BhaiShell->commands

A fun and playful terminal project where standard Linux commands are replaced with humorous Hindi phrases. Make your terminal sessions more engaging with these quirky command names while keeping the functionality intact.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>



## Installation

To use the new Hindi commands in every terminal and in different terminal sessions, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
. PATH_TO_BHAISHELL_DIRECTORY/script.sh
```
For example, if you downloaded this project to your home/ folder, the command would be:
```bash
. /home/BhaiShell/script.sh
```
If you want to run the script in a single terminal session, just navigate to the project folder and run:
```bash
. PATH_TO_PROJECT/script.sh
```
For example:
```bash
. ~/BhaiShell/script.sh
```
Alternatively, you can use the source command as well:
```bash
source ~/BhaiShell/script.sh
```
